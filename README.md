This repository lists TOP 10 vulnerabilities found during Thick Client Application penetration testing. 

Thick client application penetration is one of the gray area where-in lots of articles are available to test for the vulnerabilties but no proper guideline is available to lookup for.

- T6: Improper Input Validation
- T7: Weak Permissions
- T8: Insecure Authentication
- T9: Path Interception
- T10: Missing Memory Protection
